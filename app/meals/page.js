  // const meals = await getMeals(); //and that's it, no "useEffect" like we do in React, now we can immediatly take data from our backend file ... check bellow ğŸ‘‡ in the <main>...</main> component, there we call this variable "meals" ==== check in the "Meals()" from above ğŸ‘† and see why we deleted the "async" from here
